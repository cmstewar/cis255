<h2 class="sectitle">Twenty CSS Properties</h2>
<h3 class="border">By: Chris Stewart</h3>

<h2 align="center">Introduction</h2>

<p align="center">The purpose of this webpage is to show my favorite properties of CSS. CSS properties are very useful in making a webpage easier to read and follow. Otherwise it would just be words on the screen and have no formatting or colors to break it up.</p>

<h2 class="sectitle" style="background-color:black;">Top Five CSS Properties</h2>
<div class="column-left">
	<h3 class="title" align="center";>Shadow</h3>
	<p> 1. This is a property I found quite fascinating. It can really spice up the styling of a Title or a Box so it looks like it is jumping of the page. It can be a attention getter and make a page easier to follow. </p>
	
	<p> This property can be used as a <span class="em">text shadow</span> or a <span class="em">box shadow</span>.</p>
	
	<h3 class="border" align="center";>Border</h3> 
	
	<p> 2. This is a neat property that can really emphasize a group of words to make them stand out. </p>
	
	<p> This property can be used by adding a <span class="em">border-color</span>, a <span class="em">border-width</span>, a <span class="em">border-style</span>, a <span class="em">border-image</span>, a <span class="em">border-radius</span>, a <span class="em">border-top</span>, a <span class="em">border-left</span>, a <span class="em">border-right</span>, a <span class="em">border-bottom</span> as well as many other combinations.</p>
</div>
<div class="column-center">

	<h3 class="section" align="center";>Spacing</h3> 

	<p> 3. This is a property that is nice to use when you want to change where on a screen an image or a block of text appear.</p>		

	<p> This property can be used by adding <span class="em">padding</span>, <span class="em">padding-bottom</span>, <span class="em">padding-left</span>, <span class="em">padding-right</span>, <span class="em">padding-top</span>, <span class="em">margin</span>, <span class="em">margin-bottom</span>, <span class="em">margin-left</span>, <span class="em">margin-right</span>, or <span class="em">margin-top</span>.</p>

	<p class="animateBlue" align="center";>Animation</p> 

	<p> 4. This is a nice way to catch the eye of your reader. It draws your attention to the screen and makes it come to life. It is something that can be overdone, which makes the webpage hard to read and follow. It is good to use but in moderation.</p>

	<p> This property can be used in many forms of <span class="animateRed">animation</span> or <span class="animateGreen">transitions</span>. </p>
</div>
<div class="column-right">
	<h3 class="layout" align="center";> Layout</h3>
	<p> 5. This property helps adjust the display of the webpage. It can help keep things on the screen when the screen size is different and it can change where a line of text starts. This property is very handy when you are using multiple columns.</p>
	<p> This property can be used by adjusting the bottom, left, right, top of the webpage. It can also be used by changing the float or position of the text.</p>
