<h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
<p>There are many pros and cons to each woord press and bootstrap. I feel that for the beginner word press is a easier process in building a website. You can see the results faster and cleaner.</p>

 <p>However bootstrap is more customizable for someone who knows what thay are doing. It takes a lot more work but can have the exact look on the screen you wanted. Having used both now in a few weeks time I can say I like the finished product of Wordpress but I like knowing I created the whole thing with bootstrap.</p>
